Project description
Bike accidents in NYC remain to be a problem for the city. While most of the ~4400 collisions per year end with injuries, around 20 collisions end deadly for the cyclist. To understand the problem better and provide a platform for solutions, this project aims to answer the following questions:

1. How many accidents happen per year and when (season, time of the day) occur the majority of collisions?
2. What are the main causes and is there a relationship between the type of driver (based on the car) and the cause of accident?
3. Where are the "hot spots" for bicycle accidents? And does NYC need more bike lanes to ensure saftey for its cyclists?
4. Does your daily cycling route include "hot spots" 

Methods:
The raw data for the NYC bike collision analysis was pulled from the NYC Open Data platform [link](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95). The original dataset was processed and cleaned for further analyses. Descriptive statistics and data visualization tools were applied to answer the above stated questions.

The Shiny App can be accessed via [link](https://melanieu.shinyapps.io/NYC_bike_collisions/)

I hope you enjoy my analysis and visualization tools!
